Xero Settings
============

After you have successfully installed the [Xero Extension](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/xero/) in your [Symphony CMS](http://symphony-cms.com), this file will help you sending some data to [XERO](http://www.xero.com).

In this file you will be able to:

- Create new Contacts in Xero;
- Create new Inventory Items;
- Create new Sales Invoices;
- Create new Purchase Invoices.

Feel free to copy the file and change it.

Cheers,

Andre Bocati.
